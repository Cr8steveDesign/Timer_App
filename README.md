#COUNTDOWN TIMER APP
##Yet another test project to practice Date and Time in Javascript as well as using the Intl object format date and numbers. 

I especially enjoyed working on this app, technically building the UI on the fly. Many learning opportunities, seeing how closure, scopes and variable hoisting were really playing out in practice. 
I hope to ocassional update the app with more features as I continue on my learning journey. 

Stay tuned!
